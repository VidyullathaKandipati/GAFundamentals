This is a README file for the Memory game.

When you click first two cards or last cards, the result would be a match.
When you click on first & third or second and fourth cards the result would not match.

Known issue:
The pic on the card that is clicked second time is not being displayed but the result is as expected.

Thank you for playing this game and have fun.
